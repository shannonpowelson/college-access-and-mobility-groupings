# Grouping Colleges based on Mobility Rates and Related Metrics
## Background
For this analysis, I studied how colleges are grouped based on mobility and other related metrics.  The mobility rate is defined by [Opportunity Insights](https://opportunityinsights.org/) as the "percent of students who have parents in the Bottom 20% of the income distribution and reach the Top 20% of the income distribution".  Colleges have the potential to facilitate this mobility.  Some colleges do this better than others.  In one [research study](https://www.brookings.edu/research/opportunity-engines-middle-class-mobility-in-higher-education/), colleges with higher instructional expenditures per student were found to be associated with higher mobility rates.  But are these schools accessible to students who have parents in the bottom 20% of the income distribution?  Does high tuition and rejection rates inhibit these students from getting into a college with high mobility rates?  These questions are explored in a cluster analysis that groups colleges based on mobility rate, fraction of parents in the top 1% of the income distribution, rejection rate, and instructional expenditures per student.  On the contrary, another [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/prestoncooper2/2020/07/15/which-colleges-are-fulfilling-the-promise-of-intergenerational-mobility/?sh=22e2596163bc) claimed that high mobility rates are hindered by higher instructional expenditures per student and instead are associated with certain majors like engineering and business.  This claim is explored through another cluster analysis that groups colleges based on major and mobility rates.

## Data Analysis
To start this analysis, I performed a cluster analysis that grouped colleges based on mobility rate, fraction of parents in the top 1% of the income distribution, rejection rate, and instructional expenditures per student.  The fraction of parents in the top 1% of the income distribution was chosen to represent how financially acessible the school is to students.  The image below shows the results of the 4 anchor cluster analysis that was performed.
